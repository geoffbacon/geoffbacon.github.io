[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a computational linguist, graduating from my PhD at UC Berkeley advised by Terry Regier. My dissertation evaluates what neural networks learn about phonology, morphosyntax and semantics across more than 80 languages. I am a Senior Data Science Fellow at D-Lab, where I consult and teach on natural language processing and data science with Python. I am a researcher in the Measuring Hate Speech team, where we develop NLP methods to identify hate speech and abusive language online. I built the Cerberus app to reduce the annotation burden of linguists. This summer, I am a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, working on integrating structured lexical resources with learned semantic representations.\nBefore my PhD, I was a project manager at Kleffmann Group and taught English in Grosseto and Paris. I studied lingiustics, classics and Arabic at the University of Melbourne. As a language learner, I’ve studied French, Italian, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Middle Egyptian. As a linguist, I’ve worked on Somali, Nafsan and Tswefap, and spent two months in Nigeria conducting fieldwork on CiShigini.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://geoffbacon.github.io/author/geoff-bacon/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/geoff-bacon/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a computational linguist, graduating from my PhD at UC Berkeley advised by Terry Regier.
