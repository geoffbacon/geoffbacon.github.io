[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a computational linguist at Google. I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in 2020, advised by Terry Regier. My dissertation evaluated what neural networks learn about phonology, morphosyntax and semantics across more than 80 languages. From 2017-2020, I was a Senior Data Science Fellow at D-Lab, where I consulted and taught on natural language processing and data science with Python. I was a researcher in the Measuring Hate Speech team, where we developed NLP methods to identify hate speech and abusive language online. I built the Cerberus app to reduce the annotation burden of linguists. I was also a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute, working on integrating structured lexical resources with learned semantic representations.\nBefore my PhD, I was a project manager at Kleffmann Group and taught English in Grosseto and Paris. I studied lingiustics, classics and Arabic at the University of Melbourne. As a language learner, I’ve studied French, Italian, Arabic, Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit and Middle Egyptian. As a linguist, I’ve worked on Somali, Nafsan and Tswefap, and spent two months in Nigeria conducting fieldwork on CiShigini.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://geoffbacon.github.io/author/geoff-bacon/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/geoff-bacon/","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a computational linguist at Google.
